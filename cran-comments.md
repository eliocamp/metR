This is a resubmission. 
In this submission I added `data.table::setDTthreads(1)` to examples and tests to only use 1 core. 

In this submission I removed the gdal dependency. 

## Test environments

* local installation of elementary OS 6.1 JÃ³lnir (Built on Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS) R version 4.3.1

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes 

Thanks for all the work :)
