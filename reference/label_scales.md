# Scales for contour label aesthetics

Scales for contour label aesthetics

## Usage

``` r
scale_label_colour_continuous(
  ...,
  aesthetics = c("label_colour"),
  guide = ggplot2::guide_colorbar(available_aes = "label_colour")
)

scale_label_alpha_continuous(
  ...,
  range = c(0.1, 1),
  aesthetics = c("label_alpha")
)

scale_label_size_continuous(
  breaks = waiver(),
  labels = waiver(),
  limits = NULL,
  range = c(1, 6),
  transform = "identity",
  guide = "legend"
)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`continuous_scale`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/continuous_scale.html)

  `minor_breaks`

  :   One of:

      - `NULL` for no minor breaks

      - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
        for the default breaks (one minor break between each major
        break)

      - A numeric vector of positions

      - A function that given the limits returns a vector of minor
        breaks. Also accepts rlang
        [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
        function notation. When the function has two arguments, it will
        be given the limits and major breaks.

  `oob`

  :   One of:

      - Function that handles limits outside of the scale limits (out of
        bounds). Also accepts rlang
        [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
        function notation.

      - The default
        ([`scales::censor()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/oob.html))
        replaces out of bounds values with `NA`.

      - [`scales::squish()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/oob.html)
        for squishing out of bounds values into range.

      - [`scales::squish_infinite()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/oob.html)
        for squishing infinite values into range.

  `na.value`

  :   Missing values will be replaced with this value.

  `call`

  :   The `call` used to construct the scale for reporting messages.

  `super`

  :   The super class to use for the constructed scale

- aesthetics:

  Character string or vector of character strings listing the name(s) of
  the aesthetic(s) that this scale works with. This can be useful, for
  example, to apply colour settings to the colour and fill aesthetics at
  the same time, via aesthetics = c("colour", "fill").

- guide:

  Type of legend. Use "colourbar" for continuous colour bar, or "legend"
  for discrete colour legend.

- range:

  Output range of alpha values. Must lie between 0 and 1.

- breaks:

  One of:

  - `NULL` for no breaks

  - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
    for the default breaks computed by the [transformation
    object](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/new_transform.html)

  - A numeric vector of positions

  - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as
    output (e.g., a function returned by
    [`scales::extended_breaks()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/breaks_extended.html)).
    Note that for position scales, limits are provided after scale
    expansion. Also accepts rlang
    [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
    function notation.

- labels:

  One of:

  - `NULL` for no labels

  - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
    for the default labels computed by the transformation object

  - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)

  - An expression vector (must be the same length as breaks). See
    ?plotmath for details.

  - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as
    output. Also accepts rlang
    [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
    function notation.

- limits:

  One of:

  - `NULL` to use the default scale range

  - A numeric vector of length two providing limits of the scale. Use
    `NA` to refer to the existing minimum or maximum

  - A function that accepts the existing (automatic) limits and returns
    new limits. Also accepts rlang
    [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
    function notation. Note that setting limits on positional scales
    will **remove** data outside of the limits. If the purpose is to
    zoom, use the limit argument in the coordinate system (see
    [`coord_cartesian()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html)).

- transform:

  For continuous scales, the name of a transformation object or the
  object itself. Built-in transformations include "asn", "atanh",
  "boxcox", "date", "exp", "hms", "identity", "log", "log10", "log1p",
  "log2", "logit", "modulus", "probability", "probit", "pseudo_log",
  "reciprocal", "reverse", "sqrt" and "time".

  A transformation object bundles together a transform, its inverse, and
  methods for generating breaks and labels. Transformation objects are
  defined in the scales package, and are called `transform_<name>`. If
  transformations require arguments, you can call them from the scales
  package, e.g.
  [`scales::transform_boxcox(p = 2)`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/transform_boxcox.html).
  You can create your own transformation with
  [`scales::new_transform()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/new_transform.html).
